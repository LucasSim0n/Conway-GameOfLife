# Conway's Game of Life - Python + Tkinter

This is a simple implementation of **Conway's Game of Life**, developed in Python with a graphical interface using **Tkinter**.  
The project is split into two components:  
- A core logic engine that simulates the game.  
- A basic interactive GUI to visualize and interact with the simulation in real-time.

## üéÆ Features

‚úÖ Core logic for Conway's Game of Life  
‚úÖ Interactive grid where you can toggle cells by clicking  
‚úÖ Play, Pause, and Clear controls  
‚úÖ Adjustable simulation speed (easy to add if desired)  
‚úÖ Lightweight and easy to run (pure Python, no external dependencies)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- The game engine calculates generations based on the classic rules of the Game of Life.  
- Cells are stored efficiently using Python `set` and `dict` objects.  
- The GUI lets you click cells to turn them on or off before starting the simulation.  
- Controls allow you to start and pause the simulation at any point.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (usually comes bundled with Python)

### Run the application
```bash
python main.py
```

## üé® Controls

| Control    | Description                      |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Left Click | Toggle a cell alive/dead         |
| Play       | Starts the simulation            |
| Pause      | Pauses the simulation            |
| Clean      | Clears the entire grid           |

## ‚úÖ Rules of Conway's Game of Life

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

## üöß TODO / Planned Features

- [ ] **Dynamic grid size**  
  Add a configurable number of rows and columns from the GUI. The user should be able to increase or decrease the display size without restarting the application.

- [ ] **Reset to initial state**  
  Add a `Reset` button that allows the user to return to the original configuration they set before starting the simulation. This will involve saving the "initial state" as a reference point.

- [ ] **Adjustable simulation speed**  
  Let the user control the interval between generations (e.g., using a `Scale` widget).

- [ ] **Zoom and pan functionality**  
  Improve the visualization for larger grids by allowing zoom in/out and moving around the board.

- [ ] **Load/save board states**  
  Implement functionality to save current cell patterns to a file and reload them later.

- [ ] **More predefined patterns**  
  Add buttons to insert famous patterns like pulsars, spaceships, and oscillator
